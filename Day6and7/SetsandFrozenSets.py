## Set is a collection of items where each item is unique 
## Python has two built-in set
## SET is a mutable object 
## FROZENSET is immutable. 

# A set object is an unordered collection of distinct hashable objects. Common uses include membership testing, removing duplicates from a sequence, and 
# computing mathematical operations such as intersection, union, difference, and symmetric difference. (For other containers see the built-in dict, list, 
# and tuple classes, and the collections module.)

# Like other collections, sets support x in set, len(set), and for x in set. Being an unordered collection, sets do not record element position or order of insertion. 
# Accordingly, sets do not support indexing, slicing, or other sequence-like behavior.

# There are currently two built-in set types, set and frozenset. The set type is mutable — the contents can be changed using methods like add() and remove(). 
# Since it is mutable, it has no hash value and cannot be used as either a dictionary key or as an element of another set. The frozenset type is immutable and hashable — its contents cannot be altered 
# after it is created; it can therefore be used as a dictionary key or as an element of another set.
