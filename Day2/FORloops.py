# LOOPS 
#TWO TYPES
#INDEFINITE ITERATION - number of times loop executed depends on how many times condition is met 
#DEFINITE ITERATION - number of times executed decided in advance 
# Infinite loops, meaning code normally wrong as will keep going - press contrl + c tp stop this if it happens 

#FOR LOOPS DEFINITE ITERATION - we know how it will loop in advance. It will loop over every item and perform an action.
# INvolves assigning a temp variable. 
# Need to indent the actions. 

# Use while loops to run the same task multiple times. For loops used to loop over information once in a list of data. 

#for keyword inidcates start of the loop 
# <temporary variable> used to represent the value of the element in the collection the loop is on 
# in keyword separates temp variable from the collection 
# <collection> top loop over, ie a list 
# <action> to do anything on each iteration 
# can use break keyword to exit the loop immediately. 
# can use continue keyword inside a loop to skip the remaining code inside that loop, and move to the next iteration.

  #temp variable does not need to be defined before and can be anything.
