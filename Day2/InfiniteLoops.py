# A loop that never terminates is called an infinite loop. These are very dangerous for our code because they will make our program run forever and thus consume all of your computerâ€™s resources.

# A program that hits an infinite loop often becomes completely unusable. The best course of action is to avoid writing an infinite loop.

#can use cntr + c to stop an infinite loop 

# using a break
